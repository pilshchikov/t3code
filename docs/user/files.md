# Browse and edit files

The **Files** tab in the right panel shows a project's directories. Opening a file expands the
directories above it and leaves the rest of the tree as you had it; use the collapse button to shut
the tree.

## Selecting

Click a file to open it. Shift-click extends the selection to a range, and Command-click (Control
elsewhere) adds or removes a single file, for picking out files that are not next to each other.

## Deleting

Right-click a file or a folder and choose **Delete**. A folder takes its contents with it, and the
confirmation says so. With several files selected, press Backspace to delete all of them at once.

A delete can be undone with the platform's undo shortcut while the file list has focus, or from the
**Undo** action on the toast that confirms it. Undo is only offered when every deleted entry is a
whole text file small enough to hold on to — a folder or a binary cannot be reconstructed — and the
confirmation tells you which of the two it is going to be before you commit.

## Links inside a file

A link in a rendered Markdown file opens against the checkout the document itself was read from. A
plan file read from your project checkout links to files in that checkout, even while the thread
you are in is working in a worktree.
