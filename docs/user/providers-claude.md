# Claude

T3 Code uses Claude Code's login and configuration. Start with the default provider
for one account; [provider setup](./install.md#providers) covers installation and
shared provider settings.

## Separate accounts or configurations

Use a separate Claude config directory for each account. This also works for named
presets that need different Claude settings or a router connection.

Keep your existing account in the default directory. On the environment's machine,
create the second login:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude_personal
CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR=~/.claude_personal claude auth login
```

Add another Claude instance in **Settings > Providers**:

| Instance        | Binary path | CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR path |
| --------------- | ----------- | ---------------------- |
| Claude Work     | `claude`    | Leave empty            |
| Claude Personal | `claude`    | `~/.claude_personal`   |

An empty config-directory setting uses Claude Code's normal configuration. The
custom setting changes `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, leaving `HOME` and the system keychain
location intact. Use the same variable for the login command. Setting `HOME`
instead can put credentials where this provider will not find them.

Check the account reported in provider settings after signing in. Existing
threads can switch only between Claude instances with the same config directory.
Separate account directories stay isolated, including their local conversation
state. Claude does not have Codex's shared-home and shadow-home arrangement.

For presets that differ only in API keys or endpoints, use the instance's
**Environment variables**. Variable assignments do not belong in **Launch arguments**.

## Compact long conversations

Set **Auto-compact after** in the Claude provider settings to an integer between
`100000` and `1000000`. For example, `300000` asks Claude to summarize at about
300,000 tokens. This changes when compaction happens, not the model's context
window. Leave it empty for Claude Code's default.

You can also send `/compact` in an existing conversation. Web and desktop offer
**Compact context** from the context meter and may suggest it when you return to
a large older thread. See [commands and skills](./composer.md#commands-and-skills)
for using composer commands.

## Usage limits

If your Claude subscription runs out of usage mid-turn, the thread shows which
limit was reached and the remaining wait when Claude provides a reset time.
Claude Code holds the turn until that window reopens, so it can keep showing as
working. Wait for the reset, or stop the turn and continue later. The warning's
timestamp shows when the displayed wait started.

## Skills

Claude skills come from the config directory's `skills` folder and the project's
`.claude/skills` folder. If both define the same name, the config-directory copy
wins. Skills disabled in Claude's settings do not appear in the composer.

Use `$` in the composer to select a skill. Skills marked `disable-model-invocation`
can still be started by you. Invoke those one per message: Claude directly runs
only the last named skill and may try to start earlier ones through its Skill
tool, which refuses skills reserved for manual invocation.

## OpenRouter

Create a Claude instance with its own config directory, such as
`~/.claude_openrouter`, and keep **Binary path** set to `claude`. In that instance's
**Environment variables**, use:

| Variable               | Value                                     |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`   | `https://openrouter.ai/api`               |
| `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` | Your OpenRouter API key, marked Sensitive |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`    | An explicitly empty value                 |

If that Claude config directory has a cached Anthropic login, run `/logout` in a
Claude Code session using that directory before starting the router setup. Cached
login credentials can conflict with the router token.

Verify requests in OpenRouter's activity dashboard. For model-role overrides and
current compatibility requirements, use the
[OpenRouter Claude Code guide](https://openrouter.ai/docs/cookbook/coding-agents/claude-code-integration).

## Other routers

```text
Display name: Claude Work
Binary path: claude
CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR path: empty
```

### Set Up The Second Account

Log in with a separate config directory:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude_personal_home
CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR=~/.claude_personal_home claude auth login
```

Use `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, not `HOME`. Setting `HOME` writes the login to
`~/.claude_personal_home/.claude`, which is not where T3 Code looks.

Then add another Claude provider in T3 Code:

```text
Display name: Claude Personal
Binary path: claude
CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR path: ~/.claude_personal_home
```

Use the email shown in Settings to confirm each provider is using the intended account. Emails are
blurred by default; click the blurred email to reveal it.

### See each account's limits separately

The Usage page and the sidebar Usage hover card keep account-limit snapshots separate by Claude
provider instance. Give the providers distinct display names, such as `Claude Personal` and
`Claude Work`, so their 5-hour and weekly rows are easy to identify.

Claude limit data is received from a running Claude session. After adding or changing a provider,
start one session for that provider before expecting its Limits row to appear. The first snapshot
may be labeled **No limit data yet** until Claude sends a usage response; this is expected and does
not mean the account is unconfigured.

## Can I Switch Claude Accounts In An Existing Thread?

Usually, no.

T3 Code only offers Claude providers that use the same config directory for an existing thread. A
different config directory is treated as a different Claude environment.

This is different from the recommended Codex setup. Claude Code keeps account and local state across
multiple files under its config directory, so T3 Code keeps separate config directories isolated
instead of trying to share part of the state.

## I Want To Use OpenRouter

Use this when you want Claude Code to talk to OpenRouter directly, without running a local router.
This is the simplest external-provider setup.

OpenRouter provides a Claude Code integration through Claude's Anthropic-compatible environment
variables.

### Configure A Claude OpenRouter Provider

Add or edit a Claude provider in T3 Code Settings:

```text
Display name: Claude OpenRouter
Binary path: claude
CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR path: ~/.claude_openrouter_home
```

In that provider's Environment variables section, add:

```text
ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL   https://openrouter.ai/api
ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN sk-or-...                Sensitive
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY                              Empty value
```

Mark `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` as sensitive. T3 Code stores the value as a server secret and does not
send it back to the app after saving.

If you want this setup isolated from your normal Claude account, create that home first:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude_openrouter_home
```

If you previously used the same Claude home with a normal Anthropic login, run `/logout` in a Claude
Code session for that home before using OpenRouter. Otherwise Claude Code may keep using cached
Anthropic credentials instead of the OpenRouter token.

### Pick OpenRouter Models

OpenRouter can route Claude Code's default model roles to OpenRouter model IDs.

Example:

```text
ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_OPUS_MODEL    anthropic/claude-opus-4.6
ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_SONNET_MODEL  anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.6
ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_HAIKU_MODEL   anthropic/claude-haiku-4.5
CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL      anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.6
```

Add those to the same provider's Environment variables section if you want stable model choices.

### Verify OpenRouter Is Being Used

Open a Claude session and run:

```text
/status
```

You should see the Anthropic base URL set to:

```text
https://openrouter.ai/api
```

You can also check the OpenRouter activity dashboard for requests from your API key.

### Common OpenRouter Mistakes

- Use `https://openrouter.ai/api`, not `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1`, for Claude Code.
- Set `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` to your OpenRouter API key.
- Set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` to an empty string so Claude Code does not try to use an Anthropic login.
- Put these variables on the Claude provider instance, not in global shell startup files.

OpenRouter's setup can change over time. Use its upstream Claude Code guide for the current details:
<https://openrouter.ai/docs/guides/guides/claude-code-integration>.

## I Want To Use Claude Code Router

Claude Code Router is useful when you want a local routing layer with more control than a direct
OpenRouter setup.

T3 Code does not need a special Claude Code Router provider. Treat the router as a Claude
environment: give a Claude provider its own `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR path`, and put whatever variables
the router tells you to export into that provider's Environment variables section. Mark tokens
and API keys as sensitive.

```text
Display name: Claude Router
Binary path: claude
CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR path: ~/.claude_router_home
```

Follow the upstream project's README for the router's own install, startup, and configuration
steps: <https://github.com/musistudio/claude-code-router>.

## I Want Different Claude Settings, Not A Different Account

Create another Claude provider with the same account if you want a named preset.

Examples:

- "Claude Default"
- "Claude Router"
- "Claude Experimental"

If the preset needs different Claude files, give it a different `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR path`. If it needs
different API keys, base URLs, or router settings, use Environment variables.

Do not put environment variable assignments in `Launch arguments`.
