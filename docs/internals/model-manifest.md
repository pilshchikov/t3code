# Model manifest

`apps/server/src/provider/model-manifest.json` is bundled for offline startup. This fork fetches the
copy on upstream `main` only when `T3CODE_ENABLE_PROVIDER_VERSION_CHECKS=true` and provider update
checks are enabled. A remote fetch replaces the in-memory and on-disk cache only after generic
catalog references and provider-owned adapter data validate. A failed or invalid fetch keeps the
last successful remote manifest. Without the network opt-in, the service uses the bundle or an
existing valid cache.

A newer bundle outranks the cached remote manifest by `updatedAt`, so a release can
correct model data before the next successful fetch. Bump `updatedAt` whenever the
file changes. Fetch time cannot establish which copy contains the newer edit.

Generic catalog data describes presentation and capabilities. Each provider owns
its adapter schema and dispatch mappings. Claude uses the manifest for its entire
built-in catalog. Adding a model with an existing capability profile is a JSON
edit; a new profile is needed only for a new capability combination. Codex still
gets its model list from its app server.

`currentModels.claudeAgent` is the current-model classification overlay for
releases that predate catalog discovery; it does not add models to their catalogs.
Catalog-aware releases use `providers.claudeAgent.models[].status` instead.
Codex uses `currentModels.codex` as a legacy-classification overlay for discovered
models.

Model data is schema-validated configuration. Tests should cover resolver, cache,
and adapter semantics with synthetic model names, so adding a model never requires
tests that repeat the configuration.
