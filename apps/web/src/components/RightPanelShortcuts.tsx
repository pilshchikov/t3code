/**
 * The right panel's own shortcuts, owned once for the whole app.
 *
 * They used to live in the chat view, which meant they answered only while a chat view was mounted
 * and only when its listener happened to be ahead of the ones mounted after it. Bound to a bare
 * printable key — `§` on a Mac ISO layout is the usual choice — that was the difference between a
 * toggle and a stray character in whatever field had focus. Here it is one listener, registered
 * before anything else in the app, that answers wherever you are.
 *
 * Settings is the exception: it is where the binding is being read and edited, so a keypress there
 * belongs to the page.
